## What is Numpy?
Numpy is a library for scientific computing in python. It provides a multidimensional array object and tools for manipulating and processing these arrays.NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.

## Why Numpy?
Why use Numpy when we already have lists.
 * 3 reasons
    1. Less Memory - A Numpy array uses much less space compared to a list as demonstrated in [Numpy_Memory_Demo](Numpy_Memory_Demo.py) . 
    2. Speed - A Numpy array uses much faster compared to a list as demonstrated in [Numpy_Speed_Demo](Numpy_Speed_Demo.py) . 
    3. Convenience- It is much more convinient to perform operations in Numpy than in lists as demonstrated in [Numpy_Convenience_Demo](Numpy_Convenience_Demo.py) .
