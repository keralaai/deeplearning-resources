## Numpy


> "What I cannot create, I do not understand" - Richard Feynman

While it's possible to start your deeplearning journey with high level libraries like Tensorflow and Keras, it is highly recommended that you get your basics right. You don't fully understand an algorithm unless you can implement it from scratch.

Machine learning algorithms operate on vectors, matrices and arrays of higher dimensions. In python land, we manipulate arrays using a library called Numpy. In fact, NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. A good grasp of ndarrays and the numpy api will allow you to implement any machine learning algorithm from scratch.

## Neural Networks

If you have come here, you probably already know what neural networks are. The following [Welch Labs](http://www.welchlabs.com/) videos from 2014 is the most comprehensive (and beautiful) tutorial on neural networks I could find on youtube:

## Keras

Now that you know how to implement a neural network from scratch (good job btw), it's time to get started with high level deeplearning libraries. But which one? There are plenty to choose from; Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, CNTK, MxNet.. Let's ask my main man [Siraj](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A):

## Tensorflow

Wow your still here! If you feel you still need a bit more fine control over your graphs checkout this [Tensorflow for Deeplearning Research](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si "course website") course (CS20). Unfortunately the courses are not recorded since this is a student initiated course but going through the slides and doing the assignments in github will be enough. 

For those of you who want videos here is a playlist where Labhesh Patel goes through the slides. Do note that this video is based on the same course that was taught in 2017. [|video|](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=&list=PLIDllPt3EQZoS8gCP3cw273Cq9puuPLTg)
